<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Viblio offers web and mobile applications that help you collect, organize, search and edit your videos using proprietary technologies accessible through the Internet at <a href="http://www.viblio.com"><span class="s2">http://www.viblio.com</span></a> (the “<b>Site</b>”). Viblio is owned and operated by Video Analytics, Inc. (hereafter “<b>VAI</b>”, “<b>Viblio</b>”, “<b>us</b>”, “<b>our</b>”, “<b>we</b>”).  This Terms of Service Agreement (“<b>Terms</b>”) governs your access and use of the Site, and all services available through the Site and through the use of any applications (the “<b>Client App</b>”) you download in order to access such services (“<b>Services</b>”). “<b>You</b>” or “<b>Your</b>” means an adult user of the Site, or as the parent or guardian of any minor whom you allow access the Site, and for whom you will be held strictly responsible. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">VAI does not accept registration from users who are under 13 years of age, in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.   By visiting and contributing to content on VAI, you attest that you are at least 13 years old.</span></p>
