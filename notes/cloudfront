For a bucket to be accessible privately via a cloud front distribution,
a policy must be added and allows a cloudfront identity to read/get.

For the server, the cloudfront config is in the va*.yml files:

cloudfront:
  keypairid: APKAIT7GXEAJMNP76GCQ
  rtmp_domain: s2zz00dmduen0z.cloudfront.net
  web_domain: d3h86hsrudlmfo.cloudfront.net

The domains are associated with a particular bucket, so the staging and
prod domains are different.

Signing requires a private key file associated with 'keypairid'.  The
done in use is located: lib/cloudfront/key-pairs/pk-APKAIT7GXEAJMNP76GCQ.pem

The lib/Catalyst/Plugin/Cloudfront.pm plugin defined a cf_sign() helper
that reads the private key file and uses the keypairid to sign uris and
create urls.

The web gui needs to know the domain to use to stream files.  Since the
domain is different between staging and prod, app/lib/config.js defines
a routine that the gui calls:  config.cf_domain() which returns the
proper cloudfront streaming (rtmp) domain, or the one for staging if
there is not one registered.
